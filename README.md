## Beyond Known Reality: Exploiting Counterfactual Explanations for Medical Research
#### What if we could know what might happen in alternative scenarios in the decision space?

These codes can be utilized as a baseline for diverse studies or just to gain insights about possible approaches with the counterfactual idea. While the counterfactual methods already have generic examples, as provided in the DiCE GitHub repository, they currently lack specific applications for different kinds of usage. We have also provided utility codes for handling JSON files generated by DiCE.
